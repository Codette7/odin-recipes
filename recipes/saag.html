    <h1>Saag</h1>

    <h2>If you have trouble getting in your greens, this dish is not only delicious, but guaranteed to pack in your daily dose of iron!</h2>
    <p>Traditionally, saag is blended after cooking to rich, creamy consistency. What this recipe lacks in authenticity, it makes up for in accessibility - no matter how small your apartment kitchen and how lacking your appliances (namely, a space-consuming blender or immersion blender), you too can make this recipe! It may not be as creamy as it should be, but it's still delicious and nutritious.</p>
